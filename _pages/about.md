I am an Assistant Professor of Econometrics in the Department of Statistics at the <a href="https://www.uc3m.es/departamento-estadistica/inicio">Universidad Carlos III de Madrid</a>,  under the supervision of Prof. Esther Ruiz. I hold a Ph.D in Economics (2023) with Extraordinary Doctorate Award from the University of Barcelona, supervised by Prof. Helena Chuli√° and Prof. Jorge M. Uribe. Prior to this, I worked as a Senior Financial Analyst at the <a href="https://www.bcb.gob.bo">Central Bank of Bolivia (BCB)</a> and as an Economist at the <a href="https://www.cemla.org/index.html">Center for Latin American Monetary Studies (CEMLA)</a>.

My main fields of interest are forecasting, time series, and dynamic factor models, with applications to macro-finance and a special focus on at-risk measures.
