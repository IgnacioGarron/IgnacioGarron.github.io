I am a Juan de la Cierva research fellow in the Department of Statistics at the <a href="https://www.uc3m.es/departamento-estadistica/inicio">Universidad Carlos III de Madrid</a>,  under the supervision of Prof. Esther Ruiz. I hold a Ph.D in Economics (2023) with <a href="https://www.ub.edu/school-economics/one-of-our-phd-in-economics-alumni-receives-the-extraordinary-doctorate-award/">Extraordinary Doctorate Award</a> from the University of Barcelona, supervised by Prof. Helena Chuliá and Prof. Jorge M. Uribe. Prior to this, I worked as a Senior Financial Analyst at the <a href="https://www.bcb.gob.bo">Central Bank of Bolivia (BCB)</a> and as an Economist at the <a href="https://www.cemla.org/index.html">Center for Latin American Monetary Studies (CEMLA)</a>.

My research focuses on statistical and econometric methods for forecasting and time series analysis, with an emphasis on dynamic factor models and at-risk measures applied to macro-finance.
