I am a Visiting Professor of Econometrics in the Department of Statistics at the <a href="https://www.uc3m.es/departamento-estadistica/inicio">Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.</a>,  under the supervision of Prof. Esther Ruiz. I hold a Ph.D in Economics (2023) from the University of Barcelona, supervised by Assoc. Prof. Helena Chuli√° and Prof. Jorge M. Uribe. Prior to this, I worked as a Senior Financial Analyst at the <a href="https://www.bcb.gob.bo">Central Bank of Bolivia (BCB)</a> and as an Economist at the <a href="https://www.cemla.org/index.html">Center for Latin American Monetary Studies (CEMLA)</a>.

My fields of interests are topics related to macro-finance, forecasting, and time series, with special focus on forecasting risks in economics and finance.
